    text: Why do we battle, you ask? It's quite simple. The <color=purple>Dark Lord,
      the Grim Jester</color>, is an evil wizard who plagues our land.
  - expression: 
    text: He thinks that the world is his playground, his toy.
  - expression: 
    text: Ha! As if this were all some kind of game, to be played with! How silly!
  - expression: 
    text: Anyways, the <color=purple>Grim Jester</color> has prompted <color=purple>monsters
      and enemies</color> to come out of hiding.
  - expression: 
    text: Our goal is to take down the <color=purple>Grim Jester</color> at all costs.
  - expression: 
    text: But we must first get stronger.
  - expression: 
    text: Fortunately, the <color=purple>Grim Jester</color> has conveniently placed
      weaker monsters near the castle. You should defeat them as a training exercise.
  - expression: 
    text: Feel free to explore the castle before we set off for our next battle.
